# nightfly-configs

nightfly-configs is a easy to use list of configs tailored to powerusers that love the nightfly theme!

## Setup

**Terminals**

Install the terminal theme for your prefered terminal
The install script/configurations are in the terminal folder.
Please read the documentation of your terminal/shell.

)

**.dotfiles**

i3 has to be installed before any of these steps are taken!
To install all required dotfiles for the config you need to have all the necessary packages:

Ubuntu / Debian
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-terminal nitrogen rofi maim xclip xdotool
```

Arch 
```bash
pacman -S gnome-terminal nitrogen rofi maim xclip xdotool
```

After that all the necessary dotfiles can be moved into your .config folder (the folder structure is already correct and doesn't need to be changed)

**nvim**
