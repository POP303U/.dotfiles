**Troubleshooting**

If errors occur (no transparency, no statusbar, etc...) look at the neccessary packages!
Be ready to read errors and google if you don't understand something.
Check out the i3 docs and the many config guides. I recommend you have at least some experience before trying my config.

**Use**
These files are free of use for anybody, however credit must be given if my config / modified config is posted.
Have fun customizing your own!
